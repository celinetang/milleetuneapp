    Welcome to this awesome `streamlit` dashboard. This is our demo app to recognize insects. 
    You just need to upload a photo and we'll figure out which insect it is. 
    

    You can download the whole code here üëâ [Source code](√† remplir)

### Input data 
st.subheader("Input data")
st.markdown("""
    As a final note, you can use data that a user will insert when he/she interacts with your app.
    This is called *input data*. To collect these, you can do two things:
    * [Use any of the input widget](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets)
    * [Build a form](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/control-flow/st.form)

    Depending on what you need to do, you will prefer one or the other. With a `form`, you actually group
    input widgets together and send the data right away, which can be useful when you need to filter
    by several variables.
